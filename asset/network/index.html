Network <br>Asset <br>Creation

</a></h1></div><div class="page">
<div class="content">



<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Networks consist of nodes and segments, they are used for roads, tracks, canals, walls, fences, powerlines etc.</p>

<p>Networks are arguably the most complicated type of assets (depends on what you are creating) so this article assumes you are familiar with basic asset creation such as props and buildings, so it skips basic concepts such as what is a mesh, pivot etc.</p>





<h2 id="template">Template</h2>

<p>The template you choose will be fully imported as the starting point of your network, so choose one that is closest to your desired result. You can change almost everything later in the asset editor itself, or using ModTools scene explorer <span class="key">Ctrl+E</span> or running scripts in the console <span class="key">F7</span>.</p>





<h2 id="elevations">Elevations</h2>

<p>Depending on the AI of your network, it may have elevations such as Elevated, Bridge, Slope, Tunnel, which are their own complete networks with their own properties, lanes, segments, and nodes, which are bundled together with the Basic network inside the same .crp file.</p>

<p>Elevations trigger at specific build heights, or when chosen by the player using Fine Road Tool. Slope is used for the basic to tunnel transition.</p>





<h4 id="deleting">Deleting</h4>

<p>If you don't need specific elevations, you can delete them by opening ModTools scene explorer <span class="key">Ctrl+E</span>, going to <span class="path">Tool Controller &gt; ToolController &gt; m_editPrefabInfo &gt; m_netAI</span> and clicking Unset on the ones you don't need, then saving and loading the asset.</p>





<h4 id="adding">Adding</h4>

<p>If your template didn't have elevations, but you need them, you may be able to add them, depending on what AI your network has. This can be done by copying any other network into one of the possible elevations.</p>

<p>You can find the base game networks in scene explorer <span class="key">Ctrl+E</span>: <span class="path">Sunny</span> (or North/Tropical/European/Winter, based on the theme environment you loaded for the asset editor) <span class="path">Collections &gt; Road &gt; NetCollection &gt; m_prefabs</span>. For example you could go to <span class="path">Basic Road &gt; m_netAI</span>, click Copy on <span class="path">m_bridgeInfo</span>, and then go to <span class="path">Tool Controller &gt; ToolController &gt; m_editPrefabInfo &gt; m_netAI</span> and click Paste on <span class="path">m_bridgeInfo</span> here, then save and load the asset.</p>

<p>If you would like to copy a custom network into one of the elevations, you can also find those in scene explorer: <span class="path">Custom Prefabs &gt; ModTools.CustomPrefabs &gt; m_nets</span>.</p>





<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>

<p>The general properties are based on the AI the road has, that means for canals or cable car networks some of them might be different, this list is primarily based on the one for RoadBridgeAI, used for elevated networks of any normal road, but also contains properties which only appear on some other AI.</p>


<h4 id="half-width">Half-width</h4>

<p>This is used to determine how roads of different widths connect - nodes of narrow roads will widen to meet wider roads.</p>

<p>Used to define the width of surface paint (such as pavement, gravel, or terrain clipping) but becomes very unreliable when lower than 4.</p>

<p>It's also the width of the area affected by flatten terrain, drawable/selectable area and affects how the road will snap to the grid.</p>


<h4 id="pavement-width">Pavement Width</h4>

<p>Defines the width of the pavement on each side of the road, used to properly connect curbs with other roads at nodes. For correct nodes when intersecting with other roads, the half-width and pavement width values must be set appropriately.</p>


<h4 id="segment-length">Segment Length</h4>

<p>This needs to match the length of the mesh used for the segment (and node if used), otherwise, the road will overlap itself or have holes.</p>


<h4 id="min-max-height">Min / Max Height</h4>

<p>Defines collision area for water and building other roads over/under it.</p>


<h4 id="max-slope">Max Slope</h4>

<p>Maximum slope angle allowed for building the road.</p>


<h4 id="max-build-angle">Max Build Angle</h4>


<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GrOja4L.jpg"><p>
An example 135째 intersection.
</p></div>
<p>
Maximum angle allowed for intersecting the road. Limited to 135째 by the game.</p>


<h4 id="max-turn-angle">Max Turn Angle</h4>

<p>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d8gTuGK.jpg"><p>
Example of 90째 (left) and 89째 (right) max turn angle.
</p></div>

<p>When a node between 2 segments exceeds this angle, a node will be used, instead of a regular bent segment.</p>


<h4 id="min-corner-offset">Min Corner Offset</h4>

<p>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yEG7ZOY.jpg"><p>
Example of 0 (top) and 16 (bottom) min corner offset.
</p></div>


<p>Increases corner smoothing, this is more noticeable for sharp turns at low angles. High values will make the road hard to use in tight situations.</p>


<h4 id="build-height">Build Height</h4>

<p>When building the road, it will be created higher or lower than the player has chosen based on this value.</p>


<h4 id="surface-level">Surface Level</h4>

<p>CO states this is the default height for vehicles and pedestrians, although it seems ingame the individual vertical offset for lanes is used instead.</p>


<h4 id="create-pavement-gravel-ruining">Create Pavement / Gravel / Ruining</h4>

<p>Applies surface paint based on the half-width of the road.</p>


<h4 id="flatten-terrain">Flatten Terrain</h4>

<p>Flattens terrain based on the half-width of the road.</p>


<h4 id="lowers-terrain">Lowers Terrain</h4>

<p>Lowers terrain based on the half-width of the road. Usually used for elevated roads to prevent the terrain from clipping into them.</p>


<h4 id="clip-terrain">Clip Terrain</h4>

<p>Uses terrain clipping to create a hole in the ground, the actual hole is slightly smaller than the half-width, and it becomes very unreliable when half-width is less than 4. This also creates ruining around the hole.</p>


<h4 id="follow-terrain">Follow Terrain</h4>

<p>Places nodes according to terrain when building the road. Usually disabled for elevated or tunnel networks.</p>


<h4 id="flat-junctions">Flat Junctions</h4>

<p>Forces area around nodes to be completely flat. Note that the centers of intersections will be flat no matter what.</p>


<h4 id="clip-segment-ends">Clip Segment Ends</h4>

<p>Enables the use of bent nodes on intersections, used for most normal roads. If disabled and the network has no nodes, the segments will connect directly, which is used for wall networks, or with an offset based on min corner offset.</p>


<h4 id="twist-segment-ends">Twist Segment Ends</h4>

<p>Twists segment ends to align to the pillar, only used for power lines and cable car paths to make sure the wires connect to the pylon correctly.</p>


<h4 id="straight-segment-ends">Straight Segment Ends</h4>

<p>Tries to prevent the segment ends from bending/skewing at intersections.</p>


<h4 id="enable-bending-segments">Enable Bending Segments</h4>

<p>Automatically bends segments when building intersections at sharp angles.</p>


<h4 id="enable-bending-nodes">Enable Bending Nodes</h4>

<p>Use a bent segment instead of a node on sharp corners.</p>


<h4 id="can-cross-lanes">Can Cross Lanes</h4>

<p>Allows traffic to cross oncoming lanes at intersections, disabled only for roads with medians.</p>


<h4 id="can-collide">Can Collide</h4>

<p>Enables checking for collisions when building.</p>


<h4 id="block-water">Block Water</h4>

<p>Used for the dam, canals, flood wall, quay. Blocks water based on half-width and min/max height properties.</p>


<h4 id="auto-remove">Auto Remove</h4>

<p>Destroys the road when something else is built over it, if can collide is enabled. Used for pedestrian paths, walls, trench, and powerlines</p>


<h4 id="connect-group">Connect Group</h4>

<p>Nodes of the current or other networks which match this connect group and have direct connect enabled will show up in intersections. For example - tram track nodes do this.</p>


<h4 id="enable-zoning">Enable Zoning</h4>

<p>Creates the zoning grid based on the road half-width, but no closer than 8m to the center.</p>


<h4 id="double-length">Double Length</h4>

<p>Used for the large highway bridges, alternates between two types of pillars and allows building longer segments than usual. Only works with disabled bending segments.</p>



<h4 id="can-modify">Can Modify</h4>

<p>Unknown, enabled for all elevated networks.</p>


<h4 id="traffic-lights">Traffic Lights</h4>

<p>Enables the traffic lights node flag for intersections involving the road. The actual traffic light props themselves must be added as lane props.</p>

<p>Only used for Double Length networks, used for the large highway bridges for alternating pillars.</p>


<h4 id="bridge-middle-pillar-offset">Bridge / Middle Pillar Offset</h4>

<p>Raises or lowers the pillars.</p>




<h3 id="hidden-properties">Hidden Properties</h3>

<p>Some properties are not visible in the road editor UI, but can be changed by using <a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=450877484'>ModTools</a> scene explorer <span class="key">Ctrl+E</span> and going to <span class="path">Tool Controller > ToolController > m_editPrefabInfo</span>.</p>

<h4 id="m_enablemiddlenodes">m_enableMiddleNodes</h4>

<p>If this is disabled, every node will be an intersection. This is disabled for train or monorail station tracks so they always have the track cross node, and also for road slope(tunnel entrance) networks.</p>





<h2 id="lanes">Lanes</h2>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/asxDJHG.jpg"><p>
Vanilla six-lane road segment mesh.
</p></div>

<p>The mesh for segments and nodes usually is an extruded profile, but some also have railings or other details. The mesh itself is usually 64 meters long, and it will always stretch for the entire segment, so it's not recommended to rely on the segment mesh for anything else other than the extruded profile, and use lane props for such details instead.</p>

<p>The mesh is also subdivided multiple times, usually 16. The more subdivisions, the smoother it will look when bending.</p>

<p>Node mesh also requires a cut through the middle, so the game can split it for use in intersections, it will also place the center vertex in the middle of the intersection.</p>



<h3 id="uv-mapping">UV Mapping</h3>

<p>Normally you only have control over the horizontal (U) UV mapping (horizontal/vertical is called UV when talking about the texture image itself) because the game will automatically tile it along the segment depending on how long the segment is.</p>

<p>You may have details for which you want to disable this automatic tiling, this can be done using vertex paint - by setting the green channel for those parts to 0, which means those parts would be 255,0,255 (magenta). This will make sure the texture is exactly as you UV map it, so it will stretch together with the segment.</p>

<div class="content-info"><em>
You can use <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1274199764">the Network Tiling mod</a> to change how much the texture is tiled along the segments and nodes.

<h3 id="wire-shader">Wire Shader</h3>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/He2diBn.jpg"><p>
The vanilla powerline wire mesh showing vertex paint and uv mapping.
</p></div>
<p>
The wire shader requires a specific kind of mesh - each "wire" should be a vertical plane, which can be subdivided and curved like the vanilla powerlines.</p>

<p>It should be UV Mapped horizontally from -1 to 1 but the height of the uv mapping depends on the height of the mesh, for example - on the vanilla powerline mesh each wire is 4m high, so the UV mapping vertically goes from -2 to 2.</p>

<p>The vertex paint green channel must be 0. The blue channel controls the amount of sway in the wind, 0 means no sway. The red channel controls the phase of the sway.</p>




<h2 id="textures">Textures</h2>


<h3 id="diffuse">Diffuse</h3>


<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vTKFr8K.jpg"><p>
An example diffuse texture for an expressway.
</p></div><p>

Just like any diffuse texture, defines the main color of the network.</p>

<p>Defaults to white.</p>


<h3 id="alpha">Alpha</h3>

<p>When black, on the basic shader, it displays the terrain underneath, on other shaders it works like an alpha map usually would.</p>

<p>Black means invisible, white is visible. Defaults to white.</p>


<h3 id="pavement">Pavement</h3>

<p>Usually displays the map theme pavement texture, but for the rail shader - it shows gravel instead.</p>

<p>Black means no pavement, white means pavement. Defaults to black, unless no diffuse is imported.</p>


<h3 id="road">Road</h3>

<p>Displays the map theme upward road (asphalt) texture, which also is multiplied by the segment color.</p>

<p>Black means no asphalt, white means asphalt. Defaults to black.</p>


<h3 id="normal">Normal</h3>

<p>Works similarly to any other normal map.</p>

<p>Doesn't require any inverted channels for parts which are vertex painted magenta, but it does require the green channel to be inverted for parts using the automatic tiling.</p>

<p>Defaults to flat.</p>


<h3 id="specular">Specular</h3>

<p>Just like any specular.</p>

<p>Defaults to black.</p>
