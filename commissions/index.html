<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Recently I got my first job as a 3D artist, moved to another country, and transitioned from 3ds Max to Maya.</p>

<p>I am still interested in continuing making content for Cities: Skylines, while also practicing Maya and making money, hence why this page exists.</p>


<h2 id="assets">Assets</h2>

<p>I prefer simple non-functional assets - such as props, regular buildings, decorative networks, etc. - because they require less work in the asset editor. But still I may be willing to do more complicated assets - such as vehicles, animated buildings, networks, train stations - depending on how complex they are and how much it pays.</p>

<p>In the interest of practicing Maya and making money, I am more open to different styles of assets I usually wouldn't do.</p>


<h2 id="payment">Payment</h2>

<p>In the past I have made content for anywhere from 15 - 120 EUR. I am highly unlikely to do anything under 20 EUR, maybe only if it's a very basic prop, decorative wall network or some small decal pack. Regular buildings or props could be about 30 - 50 EUR, while more complicated buildings or vehicles could be around 50 - 100 EUR. It all depends on how much I am interested in the style of the asset, the artistic complexity of the asset, and the amount of work required in the asset editor.</p>

<p>You can pay using PayPal or even a bank transfer to my Latvian bank account. Legally I am registered as a self-employed microcompany tax payer in Latvia.</p>


<h2 id="publishing">Publishing</h2>

<p>Depending on the complexity of the asset and how busy I am, it may take anywhere from a couple days to multiple months. In some cases I may start work on the asset and show my progress before the payment, but either way the asset will only be published after I have received the payment.</p>

<p>The final asset would be public on the steam workshop, but you may request to keep it private for some time, like some youtubers have done for upcoming series.</p>
